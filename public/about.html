<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Seven, and I’m a Zoho Developer based in the Philippines. I specialise in creating efficient workflows, customising applications, and solving complex business challenges using Zoho Creator and other tools in the Zoho ecosystem.</p>

<p>With a knack for simplifying processes and a passion for learning, I bring creative problem-solving and attention to detail to every project. Whether it’s building scripts, developing widgets, or designing user-friendly solutions, my goal is to empower businesses to achieve more.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech, learning Python, or spending time with my family and our Labrador. I also enjoy sharing knowledge through blogs and collaborating on exciting new ideas.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out—let’s create something great together!</p>
